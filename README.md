### Namaste üôè

I am a quant with interest in risk management and modelling by studying the intricacies involved in the statistical properties of complex structured products. My repositories share some of my work on basic quant pricing models based on stochastic concepts like finite difference methods, girsanov theorem, crank nicholson methods, etc. I am currently working on mastering an open-source XVA engine and exploring its commerial applications in emerging economies. Feel free to reach out to me!
